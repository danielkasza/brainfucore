# BrainfuCORE Prototype

This is a quick and dirty program that can execute the bytecode format of the BrainfuCORE. Error handling is omitted.

This program exists because I wanted to validate the output of the assembler before feeding it to the verilog implementation.

## Build

`jam`

## Usage

`./bfemu < input_file.bfb`
